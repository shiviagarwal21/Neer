# Neer

The primary goal is to spread awareness among the citizens of India that we need to take care of our rivers which are soon going to be  dearth due to pollution.
With the growing times, we’ve seen how the technology has changed the world, websites have become an important part of our lives. 
This website " NEER " is an initiative that will help in cleaning water bodies which in turn will lead to saving them and preserving the environment of our country. 

# Motive behind this Project

Today, the Ganga is considered to be the sixth-most polluted river in the world. Raghubir Singh, an Indian photographer, has noted that no one in India spoke of the Ganga as polluted until the late 1970’s. 
However, pollution has been an old and continuous process in the river as by the time people were finally speaking of the Ganga as polluted, stretches of over six hundred kilometres were essentially ecologically dead zones.
Yamuna's pollution level is so bad that parts of it have been labelled 'dead' as there is no oxygen in it for marine life to survive. 
The river, which plays an important role in many religious ceremonies performed by Hindus, is home to the city's industrial waste and residential waste where people even wash their clothes and utensils on a regular basis. The worst part is that the situation only got triggered with the poor air quality that enveloped the city with smog post Diwali.
